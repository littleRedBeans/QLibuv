# QLibuv
It supports using the TCP and UDP interfaces of libuv in QT. All the code has been tested and verified in QT6. If you want to use it in QT5 or QT4, you only need to replace the EventDispatcherLibUv of this project with that of the [sjinks/qt_eventdispatcher_libuv](https://github.com/sjinks/qt_eventdispatcher_libuv) project. The public interfaces of the EventDispatcherLibUv in both projects remain consistent.
